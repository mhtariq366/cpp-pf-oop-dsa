/*
C++ is used for various purposes. It is designed to help in both high level and low level tasks.
It has good library support and helps in multiple tasks such as gaming development, general purpose tasks, 
system programming, embedded systems etc.

Below is the basic structure of C++ code.
*/


/*
This is a header file. it contains two elements, preprocessor directive #include and library name which is
written 'iostream'. There are differnt libraries used for different purposes. We'll discuss as moving forward.
*/
#include <iostream>

/*
This is the main function. We'll write all pieces of code in this block, until we study the topic of functions itself.
Code written outside the body of main function is not executable unless it is referenced in the main function's body.
Main functions body is represented by the { } curly braces. Every thing inside these braces is part of main function's body.
Main function can be written in two ways, either using 'int main' or 'void main'. If you're using int main return 0 statement needs
to be written at the end of function. We'll discuss why its this way later on. For now just just focus on basic structure.
